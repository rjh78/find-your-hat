# find-your-hat
Challenge project from Codecademy
In this project, youâ€™ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

game is built in a single class called Field. To run the game instantiate the class and then run .playGame on the class instance. Oh, give it parameters for number of rows (height) and number of columns (width) to set the size of the playing board. Can give it an optional percent parameter to indicate the percentage of 'holes' that appear on the board.
